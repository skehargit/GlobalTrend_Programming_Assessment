// Implement a simple HashMap class with put, get, and remove methods.

// hashMap is from java similar to map in javascript
// it is a object with key-value pair. we can use anydata type to create key-value pair 

// i have to sove it in javascript so i am using map 
let map = new Map();

// put is equals to set in javascript map
map.set('a','b')
console.log(map,'a is maped to b')

//get 
console.log(map.get('a'),'we get b because a is maped to b ')

//remove is equals to delete in javascript map
map.delete('a')
console.log(map,' pair deleted ')
